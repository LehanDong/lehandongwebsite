Hi! I'm **Lehan Dong (董乐晗)**, a master’s student in Business Analytics and Risk Management at Johns Hopkins University.

With a background in international economics and applied analytics, I’m broadly interested in the intersection of corporate strategy, economics, and data-informed policy. My recent work includes research and consulting projects on capital market reform, equity access in financial services, and data strategy in HR-tech.

I am currently **open to research assistant and pre-doctoral positions**, and plan to apply to **Ph.D. programs** in the upcoming cycle. I am also exploring full-time opportunities in related industry roles.

Thanks for visiting!
