Welcome to a glimpse of life beyond academics 🎒🎻

### ✈️ Traveling

I love exploring new cities, hiking quiet paths, and collecting moments along the way.

### 🎻 Playing the Cello

I've been playing cello since high school — it's my way to stay grounded. I enjoy interpreting classical pieces, and occasionally improvising for fun.
